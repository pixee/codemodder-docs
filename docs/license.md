# Licensing

Our licensing philosophy is quite simple. We provide an open source license, enabling users to create and use their own codemods for internal needs, or even share them publicly if they wish. This approach also enables us to *work in public*. However, we aim to prevent competitors, adjacent players, or cloud providers from leveraging our continued investment for their own commercial gain without benefiting all users.

## Codemodder Frameworks
All of our codemodder frameworks, the libraries for each language that are used by people to build codemods, are available as Affero GPL (AGPL).

## Core Codemods
All of our codemodder frameworks also retain a set of core codemods which are of common interest for the broad community. These are available as Affero GPL (AGPL).

## Documentation
Our documentation is available as MIT.
