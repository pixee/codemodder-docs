title: Fix-Only Codemods 
---

You may see the term "Fix-Only Codemod" in our documentation and in our code. This page discusses what differentiates "fix-only" codemods from typical codemods.

## It's about how we find the code

Fix-only codemods are a special type of codemod that use code location data that is produced by external tool. We currently support the following external tools:

* Sonar
* CodeQL
* Semgrep

If you want to make a codemod for fixing something these tools find, please look at the documentation for the codemodder project for your language.

### Sonar

To fix issues found by Sonar, take JSON returned by the Issues API, save it to a file, and pass that file to the `--sonar-issues` CLI argument.

### SARIF producing tools

To fix issues generated by CodeQL and Semgrep, pass their SARIF file output to a codemod's `--sarif` CLI argument.

## Let's support more!

Note that these are the "built-in" providers we support and for which we offer easy-to-implement supertypes. We'd be interested in fixing the stuff your favorite tool finds -- just open an issue on the codemodder framework GitHub page ([Java](https://github.com/pixee/codemodder-java/issues), [Python](https://github.com/pixee/codemodder-python/issues)).
